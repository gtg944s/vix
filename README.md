# VIX - Manipulation in a Simple Stock Market
The aim of this work is to analyze the behavior of trading agents in a simple stock market in which benchmarks for risk exposure (in our case an index that estimates volatility) are manipulated. The idea comes from recent events: at the beginning of February 2018, large fluctuations of the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), whose aim is to estimate the implied volatility of S&P500 stocks, caused a flash-crash in the US stock market. Furthermore, it is emerging now that the VIX (or the “fear gauge”, as it is called) has been manipulated by a group of individuals who were trying to keep it low in order to speculate on volatility. 
We investigate also the role of Algorithmic Trading in a crisis situation: automatic reaction to a sudden fluctuation in the market can amplify or even trigger a crash. To build the model we use NetLogo, an open source agent-based programmable modeling environment.

# Simulation 
The code of the simulation is included in the "netlogo" folder and can be run within the [Netlogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) environment.
